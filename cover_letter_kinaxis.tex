My name is Vignesh Edithal and I am currently pursuing Masters in Applied Computing (MScAC) program at University of Toronto.
Out of the 4 concentrations, I have chosen the Data Science concentration which aims to build foundation
in statistical sciences along with Machine Learning/Deep Learning. As a formal requirement of completing my program,
students are required to complete an 8 months long industrial research internship in the field of AI.

To prepare for the rigorous MScAC program at UofT, I worked towards my diploma in Data Science from IIT Madras while working full time as a software engineer.

During my Diploma and Masters program I have complete numerous labs and exams which provided me an opportunity to improve my univariate and bivariate data analysis skills. Some of the topics I have been tested upon include, data imputation, web crawling, ANOVA, Gaussian mixture modelling and data ethics/anonymization.

I aim to apply to such an internship at Kinaxis where I can leverage my data handling skills to contribute to the business problems of the firm while learning new skills to grow my career.
