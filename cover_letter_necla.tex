My name is Vignesh Edithal and I am currently pursuing Masters in Applied Computing (MScAC) program at University of Toronto.
Out of the 4 concentrations, I have chosen the Data Science concentrations which aims to build foundation
in statistical sciences along with Machine Learning/Deep Learning. As a formal requirement of completing my program,
students are required to complete an 8 months long industrial research internship in the field of AI.
I aim to apply to such an internship at NECLA to contribute to existing research problems using my research experience
in deep neural networks.
