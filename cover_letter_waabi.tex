\begin{document}

My name is Vignesh Edithal and I am currently pursuing the Masters in Applied Computing (MScAC) program at University of Toronto.
I have chosen Data Science concentration which aims to build foundation in statistical sciences along with Machine Learning/Deep Learning.
As a formal requirement of completing my program, students are required to complete an 8 months long industrial research internship in any AI domain.
I aim to apply to such an internship at Waabi to leverage my applied research skills to contribute to vision problems involving drones, self driving cars and robotics.

I joined the SAE design club in Fall 2022 at UofT due to my interest in aeronautical engineering.
In the past one semester, I have developed a target localization algorithm for the flight camera using ROS and performed calibration and tests using a custom made test setup.
